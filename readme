This project is a simple Python desktop application built using the Tkinter library that converts distances from miles to kilometers. The user enters a value in miles, clicks the calculate button, and the application displays the converted value in kilometers using the standard conversion formula (1 mile = 1.609 kilometers). The project demonstrates basic GUI development concepts such as creating windows, using labels, input fields, buttons, and handling user events in Python. It is intended as a beginner-friendly project to practice Tkinter and fundamental Python programming skills.
